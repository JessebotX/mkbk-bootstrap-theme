# mkbk Bootstrap Theme
A clean, responsive [mkbk.js](https://github.com/JessebotX/mkbk.js) layout theme, utilizing the [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com) templating engine.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository into your mkbk project's layout directory _as a git submodule_.

The following assumes you have your mkbk `workingDir` set to the root project directory.
```shell
cd YOUR_MKBK_PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY/
git submodule add https://github.com/JessebotX/mkbk-bootstrap-theme layout
```

OR, you can simply copy `index.html`, `book.html`, `chapter.html` and `assets/` into your mkbk layout directory.
